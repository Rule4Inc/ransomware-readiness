# Rule4 Ransomware Readiness Tool

## Tool Overview
This tool is intended to serve as a guide to general ransomware readiness by providing grade-based assessments. 

Controls are referenced in relation to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) functions, but are not intended to be explicit mappings to the CSF. The Control ID, Control Type, and Control Detail columns provide a set of controls that when operated at a high level of maturity should help to greatly reduce both the likelihood and impact of a ransomware event. 

Controls are classified as one of three general types, which are:
 * __Plan, Inventory & Process Maintenance:__ Controls and mechanisms to reduce ransomware risk tied to preparation and planning
 * __Threat Monitoring, Mitigation & Reduction:__ Controls intended to reduce or identify and react to threats common to ransomware
 * __Backup & Recovery Survivability:__ Controls that are closely coupled with backup solution design and operation to reduce ransomware risk

It is suggested this tool be used as a starting point for organizations, and that they perform their own risk rating and adjustments if deemed appropriate relative to their environment. To use the tool, simply score each yellow cell in the yellow Control Status column (E).

Though the sheet is protected to guide input, there is no password and protection can be removed to support adaptation to the specific needs of your environment, application of control importance weighting, etc.
